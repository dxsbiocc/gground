\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{aes()} or \code{aes_()}.}

\item{data}{A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override the}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of a
call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{layer()}. These are often aesthetics,}

\item{outliers}{Whether to display (\code{TRUE}) or discard (\code{FALSE}) outliers
from the plot. Hiding or discarding outliers can be useful when, for
example, raw data points need to be displayed on top of the boxplot.
By discarding outliers, the axis limits will adapt to the box and whiskers
only, not the full data range. If outliers need to be hidden and the axes
needs to show the full data range, please use \code{outlier.shape = NA} instead.}

\item{outlier.colour, outlier.color, outlier.fill, outlier.shape, outlier.size, outlier.stroke, outlier.alpha}{Default aesthetics for outliers. Set to \code{NULL} to inherit from the
aesthetics used for the box.

In the unlikely event you specify both US and UK spellings of colour, the
US spelling will take precedence.}

\item{radius}{The radius of the rounded corners.}

\item{notch}{If \code{FALSE} (default) make a standard box plot. If
\code{TRUE}, make a notched box plot. Notches are used to compare groups;
if the notches of two boxes do not overlap, this suggests that the medians
are significantly different.}

\item{notchwidth}{For a notched box plot, width of the notch relative to
the body (defaults to \code{notchwidth = 0.5}).}

\item{staplewidth}{The relative width of staples to the width of the box.
Staples mark the ends of the whiskers with a line.}

\item{varwidth}{If \code{FALSE} (default) make a standard box plot. If
\code{TRUE}, boxes are drawn with widths proportional to the
square-roots of the number of observations in the groups (possibly
weighted, using the \code{weight} aesthetic).}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with a warning.}

\item{orientation}{The orientation of the layer. The default (NA) automatically}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics.}

\item{geom, stat}{Use to override the default connection between
\code{geom_round_boxplot()} and \code{stat_boxplot()}. For more information about
overriding these connections, see how the \link[=layer_stats]{stat} and
\link[=layer_geoms]{geom} arguments work.}

\description{
The boxplot compactly displays the distribution of a continuous variable.
It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges
and two whiskers), and all "outlying" points individually.
}
\section{Summary statistics}{

The lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles
(the 25th and 75th percentiles). This differs slightly from the method used
by the \code{\link[=boxplot]{boxplot()}} function, and may be apparent with small samples.
See \code{\link[=boxplot.stats]{boxplot.stats()}} for more information on how hinge
positions are calculated for \code{\link[=boxplot]{boxplot()}}.

The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than
1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance
between the first and third quartiles). The lower whisker extends from the
hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the
end of the whiskers are called "outlying" points and are plotted
individually.

In a notched box plot, the notches extend \code{1.58 * IQR / sqrt(n)}.
This gives a roughly 95\% confidence interval for comparing medians.
See McGill et al. (1978) for more details.

\examples{
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy))
p + geom_round_boxplot(radius = unit(2, 'pt'))
# Orientation follows the discrete axis
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy, class)) + geom_round_boxplot()

p + geom_round_boxplot(notch = TRUE)
p + geom_round_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE)
p + geom_round_boxplot(fill = "white", colour = "#3366FF", radius = unit(2, 'pt'))
# By default, outlier points match the colour of the box. Use
# outlier.colour to override
p + geom_round_boxplot(outlier.colour = "red", outlier.shape = 1)
# Remove outliers when overlaying boxplot with original data points
p + geom_round_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)

# Boxplots are automatically dodged when any aesthetic is a factor
p + geom_round_boxplot(aes(colour = drv))

# You can also use boxplots with continuous x, as long as you supply
# a grouping variable. cut_width is particularly useful
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_round_boxplot()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_round_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(carat, 0.25)))
# Adjust the transparency of outliers using outlier.alpha
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_round_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(carat, 0.25)), outlier.alpha = 0.1)

# It's possible to draw a boxplot with your own computations if you
